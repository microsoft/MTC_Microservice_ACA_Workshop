## Sample for the Build your first microservice in .NET learn module

Microservice applications are composed of small, independently versioned, and scalable customer-focused services that communicate with each other over standard protocols with well-defined interfaces. Each microservice typically encapsulates simple business logic, which you can scale out or in, test, deploy, and manage independently.  Smaller teams develop a microservice based on a customer scenario and use any technologies that they want to use. This module will teach you how to build your first microservice with .NET.

In order to run the code in this repo as a microservice, please complete the [Build your first microservice in .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/dotnet-microservices).

### Steps to run

1. You will need to compete the **Dockerfile** in the backend folder.
2. Craete Azure Pipeline and Build using the Dockerfile
3. Push the docker image into Azure Container Registry
4. Create Azure Container App Environment
5. Create Azure Container App and deploy the image
